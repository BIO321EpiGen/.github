# Chromatin and Gene Regulation Research Group

Welcome to the GitHub organization of our research group. We are dedicated to understanding how chromatin dynamics regulate gene expression, how these mechanisms are inherited epigenetically, and how their alteration contributes to human disease.

##  Research Projects

Our research focuses on several interconnected areas:

###  Chromatin Remodeling and Gene Expression

Chromatin is the structural framework where all essential DNA processes—transcription, replication, repair, and recombination—take place. To access DNA, enzymatic machineries rely on chromatin remodeling complexes that reposition nucleosomes, often using ATP hydrolysis.

A major line of research investigates **CHD8**, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler. CHD8 binds to promoters of transcriptionally active genes and regulates their expression. Importantly, heterozygous mutations in the *CHD8* gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We are actively studying the molecular mechanisms linking CHD8 dysfunction to ASD.

###  Enhancers and 3D Chromatin Structure

Enhancers are distal DNA elements that control gene transcription, often across long genomic distances. The human genome contains over one million enhancers, many of which remain poorly characterized.

We have systematically mapped and catalogued enhancers in mouse mammary epithelial cells and characterized their regulation by **TGFβ**, a key inducer of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our studies revealed that TGFβ treatment causes a widespread increase in chromatin accessibility at about 80% of all enhancers—regardless of whether they are transcriptionally activated, repressed, or unaffected—highlighting the dissociation between enhancer accessibility and activity.

In addition, we study how **3D chromatin organization** relates to gene co-expression. Using Hi-C chromatin contact data, we have defined **Co-Expression Domains (CODs)**—clusters of collinear genes with coordinated expression and similar patterns of 3D contacts.

###  Metastasis Epigenetics: EMT and MET

Epithelial and mesenchymal cellular phenotypes represent opposite ends of a dynamic spectrum of cell states. EMT and its reversion, MET, are processes essential in development but also involved in cancer progression, metastasis, chemoresistance, and the generation of cancer stem cells.

We study the large-scale reprogramming of transcription and chromatin that occurs during EMT and MET. Our work focuses on chromatin factors such as **HMG20A**, part of the LSD1/CoREST histone demethylase complex. We have shown that HMG20A represses epithelial gene expression and interacts with the histone reader **PHF14** via a coiled-coil domain.
